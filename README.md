# BED-Roadmap
This is a repository to document all the projects I create while developing skills to be a BED
#Java
The first thing I have done is learnt Java again. Though I've learnt and developed programmes in Java, I felt that it was important that I went over some key concepts like File Handling, Polymorphism, Error Handling and Generics. So I read the book Learn Java in One Day and Learn it well. I must say that it was rewarding to have a refresh of the language I know and love.
# Git and Git Hub
I moved on to learn Git and Git Hub. The resource I used was my NIIT textbook and it helped me understand what version control is and why it's important. I was able to learn the difference between Git and Git Hub and how to use them. I then decided to create this repository to document all my projects that will help me accomplish my goal. 
# Data Structures and Algorithms
I won't say that I'm not scared of this next step but I know it's something I have to do. I will make sure to find a good resource and dedicate my time to learning this skill.

PS: The roadmap I'm using is Mosh Hamedani's road map to becoming a BED.
